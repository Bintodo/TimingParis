# Contributing

By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the [code of conduct].

[code of conduct]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md

Issues are well accepted, as well as pull requests with edits on README.md.
For different ideas, get in contact first if you want to issue a pull request.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/factory_bot_rails.git


The repository does not contain the raw data (because I don't know it's license yet).
As consequence, if you want to work on the code, you need to run the `TimingParis.py` script for few days first.

Make your changes.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]:

[pr]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails/compare/

1. Do not include any data file. Only code, and plots.
2. Write a [good commit message][commit].
